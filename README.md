## Configuration

See the `docker-compose.yml` file

# Build the image

You can build the image yourself. You might want to adjust the desired jira version in `.env`

```
docker-compose build jira
```

# Run in debug mode

If you want to run JIRA with a debug port, please see `examples/debug` - esentially what we do is
 - we add the debug port as an env parameter
 - we overwrite the start-jira.sh script so we do not user `catalina.sh run` as startup bun rater `catalina.sh jpda run` .. that is about anything we changed in there
 - we expose the port 5005 to the host so we can connect
